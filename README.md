# AR_Gesture_Controlled_Car
## Code for controllinng car using serial communication between 2 Arduino boards
This folder has codes for 2 different Arduino boards to transmit information via serial communication. The end result is Controlling the movements of car using motion of IMU sensor.

The merged code does the same thing using only one Arduino Board, which eliminates the need for serial coomunication.
